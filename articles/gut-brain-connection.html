  <main>
<h2>What Is the Gut-Brain Axis?</h2>
<p>The gut-brain axis is a two-way communication network between your gut and brain, linked through hormones, nerves, and bacteria. 90% of serotonin is made in the gut!</p>

<h2>Signs It’s Off Balance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Anxiety or depression without clear triggers</li>
  <li>Brain fog and difficulty focusing</li>
  <li>Digestive problems + emotional ups and downs</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Support It</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Probiotics:</strong> Look for strains like L. rhamnosus and B. longum for mood support</li>
  <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory foods:</strong> Omega-3s, leafy greens, berries</li>
  <li><strong>Mindful practices:</strong> Yoga, journaling, vagus nerve stimulation</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“I didn’t believe probiotics could change my mental health… but 3 weeks in, I feel noticeably calmer.” —Comment from Quora</blockquote>

<h2>Best Picks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#">Probiotic blend for anxiety</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Ashwagandha + probiotic stack</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>When your gut is inflamed or imbalanced, your mental wellness suffers. Support both by improving your microbiome—and watch the fog lift.</p>
